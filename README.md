# Banking_in_Python_GUI
GUI based banking app

Hello buddies!!

I have uploaded the console based banking in python program, now I have made the GUI version of it. Here you will be able to get new features but on graphical basis.

All of the data is stored in the backend means database. I have created and tested the database. For the project I have used SQL version of the database.

Also, the required modules which I have used in the project is mentioned in he requirements.txt. Furthermore, if you wat the rough idea of the whole project, then you can get it from outline.txt

Whole code is divided in different functions and it is free to use....

Enjoy.......

If there is any problem in the code or you want to give your suggestion for the code then you can contact me by email maharshichokshi2003@gmail.com
